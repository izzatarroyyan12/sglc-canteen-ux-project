# SGLC Canteen App: Market Research and Usability Testing

This repository contains my project for creating and evaluating a prototype app for ordering food and reserving seats at the SGLC Canteen, conducted as part of a UX course.

## Project Overview
The project consisted of three main phases:
1. **Market Research**: Understanding user needs through data analysis to determine whether the app is necessary.
2. **Prototype Creation**: Designing a user-friendly app prototype to facilitate food ordering and seat reservation.
3. **Usability Testing**: Conducting hypothesis testing to evaluate the prototype's performance in terms of task success, time efficiency, user satisfaction, and error rates.

## Files in the Repository
- **`SGLC_Market_Research_Visualization.ipynb`**: 
  - Explores user survey data to visualize insights about the need for the application.
  - Uses Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

- **`SGLC_UX_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb`**: 
  - Analyzes usability testing results, including task success rates, time on task, user satisfaction, and errors.
  - Implements hypothesis testing using statistical methods like McNemar's test and paired t-tests.

- **`sglc_market_research.csv`**:  
  - Contains the raw survey data collected from SGLC canteen users.  
  - Includes user responses to questions about satisfaction, seat availability, canteen crowding, and interest in a reservation system.  
  - Serves as the foundation for insights used to guide prototype development.  

## Technology Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Statsmodels)
- Prototyping tool: Maze
